hungry-kittens
==============

This is a web sockets demo. Multiple hungry kittens connect to the same room where they can: move (arrow left and right), jump (arrow up) and meow for food (space bar). Mobile players can use the controls on the page.

There's a live instance of this demo at http://parb.es:4000/ But it may or may not be up and running when you try to use it...

To run this demo yourself, you need to:

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `node server.js`
3. Make sure you have a browser that supports web sockets and web sockets enabled
4. Go to localhost:8080, open multiple instances (tabs) to see more than one kitten at the same time
5. Use the arrows to move and jump and the space bar to meow, in mobile you can use the controls on the page
6. For extra fun, tell friends to connect to your ip and join you!
